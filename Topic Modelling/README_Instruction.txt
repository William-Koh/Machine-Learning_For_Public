This Folder is about Machine Learning, Topic Modelling. My Machine Learning script will read the 11 Articles from "General_Election2020_11_Articles_FULL.txt" file then cluster and summarise file content into 5 Clusters (I set it to 5 clusters & 15 words per cluster. These 2 settings can be varied). The script takes about 3-5 seconds to produce the report, "Topic Modelling Report (General_Election2020_11_Articles_FULL).xlsx"

NOTE: I didn't upload my Topic Modelling script here. 
My purpose is to show case what Topic Modelling can do in Text Data Analysis


Advantage of Topic Modelling
(1) Summarise gigantic text into simple text for fast reading and summarisation
(2) Topic Modelling applies to individual articles or combine articles depending on how you feed the script (Indivdual or Combine input articles)
